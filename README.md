> **Possibly the most flexible, easy to use, and intelligent Obsidian AI assistant?**  

**YOLO (You Orchestrate, LLM Operates)** is an intelligent assistant for Obsidian, built for the Agent era.

With YOLO you can:

- 💬 Chat with LLMs directly in the sidebar
- 📚 Treat your entire vault as the AI's knowledge base
- ✍️ Summon Smart Space to continue your ideas anywhere
- ⚡ Use Quick Ask for instant inline AI assistance with intelligent editing
- 🧩 Enable experimental features like Learning Mode and sub-agents to explore personalized workflows
- 🎨 Enjoy numerous UX improvements and UI polish

YOLO will keep evolving toward agent orchestration, long-range task management, and multi-model collaboration, aiming to become your **serious learning assistant and knowledge partner** in the age of large language models.

## Feature Preview
Here’s a glimpse of YOLO’s core capabilities. Explore the plugin for more details:

## **💬 Sidebar Conversations**

Seamless conversations with LLMs, with context injection, preset prompts, custom providers, and smart Markdown parsing/generation. New chats start with the default title "New message" until the first response renames them.

## **🧠 Knowledge Base Q&A**

## **✍️ Smart Space**

Summon Smart Space anywhere for natural, fluent, and efficient content generation.

## **⚡ Quick Ask**
> The edit modes of this feature require certain tool-calling capabilities from the model. We recommend using mainstream reasoning models.

Quick Ask is a lightweight inline assistant that you can summon anywhere with a trigger character (default: `@`). It provides three powerful modes:

- **Ask Mode** 💬: Engage in multi-turn conversations and get instant answers
- **Edit Mode** ✏️: Generate structured edits with preview before applying
- **Edit (Full Access)** ⚡: Apply AI-generated edits directly without confirmation

Quick Ask supports three types of edit operations:

- **CONTINUE**: Append content to the end of your document
- **REPLACE**: Replace existing text with improved versions
- **INSERT AFTER**: Insert new content after specific text

The AI intelligently chooses the appropriate format based on your instructions, making document editing seamless and efficient.

## **🪡 Cursor Chat**

Add it with one click—always within reach.

Supports multiple providers (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, etc.) with native i18n language switching.
